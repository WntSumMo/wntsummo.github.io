      <div class="modal-content__story">
        <p>I was born on August 9, 1967 in Bonn. My first station after my apprenticeship at VR Bank Untertaunus led me to Dresdner Bank investment management at the beginning of 1990. During the following 9 years of being part of Dresdner Bank Group, I acquired comprehensive knowledge in the entire back office operations of a capital management company with a special focus on fund accounting.</p>
        <p>I joined DG BANK in 1999. Here I was jointly responsible for setting up the entire back office when Quoniam Asset Management GmbH was founded. In addition, I acquired know-how about the structure and processes of a capital management company during my time there. </p>
        <p>In 2001 my path led me to FRANKFURT-TRUST Investment GmbH (member of BHF Bank Group). There I took over the management of the fund accounting department and legal reporting of the funds. I was significantly involved in establishing the client business (insourcing of administrative services), which started with the first productive client at the end of 2002. Due to the expansion of this successful business model, Frankfurter Service KAG was spun off at the beginning of 2006. Since October 2006 I was responsible as managing director for the fund accounting, master data, legal reporting, corporate organization and finances. </p>
        <p>After eight years at BHF BANK Group, I joined Universal Investment in 2009. There I established the insourcing division as a separate profit centre. In addition to acquiring new clients, I was responsible for key account management Insourcing and the development of new products.</p>
        <p>In 2016 my path led me to HANSAINVEST in Hamburg. Here, as an independent profit centre, I was responsible for business development and the organisational and personnel management of the Frankfurt branch.  The focus was on the acquisition and management of private label funds and insourcing of clients. In addition, I was responsible for sales and relationship management in the Financial Assets department.</p>

        <p>I was born on 24 February 1965 in Vienna. I started my career at the age of 20 with an apprenticeship as a banker at Deutsche Bank AG in Offenbach. In addition to the typical counselling activities in customer and credit business, I had my first contact with the field of securities advisory and settlement. 
          Partly because of the bank's outdated systems at the time, I decided in the summer of 1989 to study computer science with a secondary subject in business administration at the Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe University in Frankfurt. During this time, I was deeply engaged in the programming of modern, distributed algorithms and systems, as well as neural networks. At the Institute for Operations Research I was able to gain experience as a research assistant in this interesting subject area. I was able to successfully complete my studies in early 1996 with the academic degree in computer science.
        </p>
        <p>In spring 1996 I joined IBM Deutschland GmbH in Frankfurt as Availability Manager. In this newly created position at IBM, one of my tasks was to show large bank customers migration paths to new architectures and to implement this successfully together with IBM within the scope of projects. Among other achievements, I was also able to transform the branch offices of Deutsche Bank AG from mainframe terminals to a completely new client-server infrastructure. For the new system landscape, it was necessary to establish new service structures within the IBM divisions to ensure the availability of hardware and software environments. The concept I developed was rolled out at IBM as a standard service throughout the entire organization.
        </p>
        <p>After my change to Oracle Deutschland GmbH in Dreieich in autumn 1998 I was more involved with databases and web applications. In the course of customer projects, I developed database-driven solutions for controlling in banks, which could be used internationally. Before the exciting turn to the year 2000, when many customers had to check the systems for future capability, I took over the Oracle project business at banks and insurance companies as Practice Manager in the central region and was thus able to successfully lead a consulting team for the individual project business at Oracle.
        </p>
        <p>In 2001 I joined the board of DIAMOS AG, a software product house for standard software in asset management. In addition to managing the company, my tasks included the reorganization of the company and the complete redesign of the entire product range to a modern platform architecture. As spokesman of the board, I achieved the professionalization of the development processes and the expansion of the company from 10 to approx. 70 employees due to the corresponding profit situation. Together with the pilot customers for the product lines I was able to successfully realize the new product development in projects spanning several years, thus enabling both the customers and DIAMOS to move into the future.
        </p>
        <p>My next career step led me back to consulting in 2006, where I was responsible for the development of the consulting business in asset management as a member of the board of Value & Risk AG. The know-how and software products in the field of financial derivatives and risk management at banks were excellently suited to help investment companies implement the then emerging German Derivatives Regulation to promote the German financial market. Besides other activities, I developed a concept for a valuation service of complex financial derivatives "as a service", achieved a large number of satisfied customers in the sales of this outsourcing solution and was thus able to establish the new business segment together with the colleagues responsible for production. This service is now the core business of the company.
          In February 2010, I decided to found my own management consultancy, concedro GmbH, whose strategic orientation is to provide high-quality functional consultancy for banks, asset managers and financial service institutions. With an expert team of approx. 25 colleagues, the brand concedro Business Forward is now well known in the industry. We have very successfully helped many small, medium and large institutes to realign and optimize their business areas and internal organization.</p>

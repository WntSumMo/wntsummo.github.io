        <p class="benefits__text-item">The investment process of QuantStyle Capital Management is based on a solely
          quantitative approach, which only considers certain market indicators and will not take subjective opinions
          regarding single securities or markets into consideration. Our investment model excludes common assumptions
          such as normally distributed or linear correlations and therefore offers returns above the performance
          compared to the respective index, especially in times of falling markets. <br>
          We apply a modified Black-Litterman approach. The modification generates a robust excess return beating the
          selected index - with less implied risk. Steering the QuantStyle Capital Management investment model is
          long-term capital growth.
          The final allocation to sectors and the subsequent selection is the unaltered result of the applied selection
          algorithm.
          The selection of individual investment stocks is only based on stochastic opinion of the market and is subject
          to a balanced risk/return approach. Consequently, the focus of QuantStyle Capital Management is not return
          maximization, but a medium to long-term, robust yield generation. Currencies and the respective interest rate
          risks are a residual component of the model and will not be hedged. The investment horizon focusses
          essentially on equities. These are listed and monitored on renounced markets and are traded on a daily and
          ongoing basis. Therefore, liquidity risk is avoided. In times of major market volatility, all securities may
          be sold as part of a loss limitation process, so that the portfolio can also be fully invested in near-money
          market instruments in these severe situations.

            company analysis, the Q-factor that has been tested over many years plays a significant role. The Q-factor
            is a synthetic index that is used to actively manage risk and is integrated in the in-house trading system.
            Based on quantitative and qualitative factors, signals are generated to adjust the investment degree,
            hedging and individual security allocation. The result is a clear and sustainable risk management that can
            be implemented according to the investment strategy.</p>

              An important criterion for responsible investing is the exclusion from the investment universe of
              companies and issuers that have a clearly negative balance sheet with regard to environmental aspects.
              High consumption of fossil fuels, low energy efficiency or generation of serious environmental damage are
              examples of negative criteria.

      <div class="modal-content__story">
        <p>I was born on August 9, 1967 in Bonn. My first station after my apprenticeship at VR Bank Untertaunus led me
          to Dresdner Bank investment management at the beginning of 1990. During the following 9 years of being part of
          Dresdner Bank Group, I acquired comprehensive knowledge in the entire back office operations of a capital
          management company with a special focus on fund accounting.</p>
        <p>I joined DG BANK in 1999. Here I was jointly responsible for setting up the entire back office when Quoniam
          Asset Management GmbH was founded. In addition, I acquired know-how about the structure and processes of a
          capital management company during my time there. </p>
        <p>In 2001 my path led me to FRANKFURT-TRUST Investment GmbH (member of BHF Bank Group). There I took over the
          management of the fund accounting department and legal reporting of the funds. I was significantly involved in
          establishing the client business (insourcing of administrative services), which started with the first
          productive client at the end of 2002. Due to the expansion of this successful business model, Frankfurter
          Service KAG was spun off at the beginning of 2006. Since October 2006 I was responsible as managing director
          for the fund accounting, master data, legal reporting, corporate organization and finances. </p>
        <p>After eight years at BHF BANK Group, I joined Universal Investment in 2009. There I established the
          insourcing division as a separate profit centre. In addition to acquiring new clients, I was responsible for
          key account management Insourcing and the development of new products.</p>
        <p>In 2016 my path led me to HANSAINVEST in Hamburg. Here, as an independent profit centre, I was responsible
          for business development and the organisational and personnel management of the Frankfurt branch. The focus
          was on the acquisition and management of private label funds and insourcing of clients. In addition, I was
          responsible for sales and relationship management in the Financial Assets department.</p>

        <p>I was born on 24 February 1965 in Vienna. I started my career at the age of 20 with an apprenticeship as a
          banker at Deutsche Bank AG in Offenbach. In addition to the typical counselling activities in customer and
          credit business, I had my first contact with the field of securities advisory and settlement.
          Partly because of the bank's outdated systems at the time, I decided in the summer of 1989 to study computer
          science with a secondary subject in business administration at the Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe University in
          Frankfurt. During this time, I was deeply engaged in the programming of modern, distributed algorithms and
          systems, as well as neural networks. At the Institute for Operations Research I was able to gain experience as
          a research assistant in this interesting subject area. I was able to successfully complete my studies in early
          1996 with the academic degree in computer science.
        </p>
        <p>In spring 1996 I joined IBM Deutschland GmbH in Frankfurt as Availability Manager. In this newly created
          position at IBM, one of my tasks was to show large bank customers migration paths to new architectures and to
          implement this successfully together with IBM within the scope of projects. Among other achievements, I was
          also able to transform the branch offices of Deutsche Bank AG from mainframe terminals to a completely new
          client-server infrastructure. For the new system landscape, it was necessary to establish new service
          structures within the IBM divisions to ensure the availability of hardware and software environments. The
          concept I developed was rolled out at IBM as a standard service throughout the entire organization.
        </p>
        <p>After my change to Oracle Deutschland GmbH in Dreieich in autumn 1998 I was more involved with databases and
          web applications. In the course of customer projects, I developed database-driven solutions for controlling in
          banks, which could be used internationally. Before the exciting turn to the year 2000, when many customers had
          to check the systems for future capability, I took over the Oracle project business at banks and insurance
          companies as Practice Manager in the central region and was thus able to successfully lead a consulting team
          for the individual project business at Oracle.
        </p>
        <p>In 2001 I joined the board of DIAMOS AG, a software product house for standard software in asset management.
          In addition to managing the company, my tasks included the reorganization of the company and the complete
          redesign of the entire product range to a modern platform architecture. As spokesman of the board, I achieved
          the professionalization of the development processes and the expansion of the company from 10 to approx. 70
          employees due to the corresponding profit situation. Together with the pilot customers for the product lines I
          was able to successfully realize the new product development in projects spanning several years, thus enabling
          both the customers and DIAMOS to move into the future.
        </p>
        <p>My next career step led me back to consulting in 2006, where I was responsible for the development of the
          consulting business in asset management as a member of the board of Value & Risk AG. The know-how and software
          products in the field of financial derivatives and risk management at banks were excellently suited to help
          investment companies implement the then emerging German Derivatives Regulation to promote the German financial
          market. Besides other activities, I developed a concept for a valuation service of complex financial
          derivatives "as a service", achieved a large number of satisfied customers in the sales of this outsourcing
          solution and was thus able to establish the new business segment together with the colleagues responsible for
          production. This service is now the core business of the company.
          In February 2010, I decided to found my own management consultancy, concedro GmbH, whose strategic orientation
          is to provide high-quality functional consultancy for banks, asset managers and financial service
          institutions. With an expert team of approx. 25 colleagues, the brand concedro Business Forward is now well
          known in the industry. We have very successfully helped many small, medium and large institutes to realign and
          optimize their business areas and internal organization.</p>
